            <h2>Why a blog about dogs?</h2>
            <p>Well, why not? dogs are exceptional creatures and should be talked about more often. They bring joy to our lives and are good emotional supporters. As a dog lover myself i decided to start this blog to create awareness of the gem of a creature we have around us and to also educate dog owners of how to properly take care of their furry babies. Plus, i'm also looking for an excuse to talk about dogs all day long so of course i'll take the opportunity.</p>
            <h2>Who is this blog for?</h2>
            <p>Good question, but the answer is certainly not dogs. Now there are 2 categories of people reading this blog post. First the ones that are yet to get a dog and second, the ones that already have a dog. Regardless of whichever category you fall into you're in the right website. The content of this blogpost is to convince (and not confuse) you on why you should get a dog and if you already do you'll be getting free tips and tricks on how to properly manage them.</p>
